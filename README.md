# Domain_checker
Domain_checker application is the trial/demo version for the new EASM (External Attack Surface Management) system called HydrAttack (hydrattack.com), the main idea of which is, based only on the domain name, find almost all of the subdomains and their top 100 open ports

Usage example:
--------------
```
chmod +x domain_checker.sh
./domain_checker.sh
> Enter the domain you want to enumerate
```
or
```
bash ./domain_checker.sh
> Enter the domain you want to enumerate
```
